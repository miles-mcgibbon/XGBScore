This project aims to use gradient boosted decision trees for binary classification of protein-ligand Kd. The model will be built in Python 3 using XGBoost and scikit-learn, and trained on data from the following databases:
- Binding MOAD
- PDBBind

Please see my [**lab book**](https://github.com/miles-mcgibbon/XGBScore/blob/main/labbook/Labbook.ipynb) for extensive details of the work done so far, and explanations of the scripts in this repository.
